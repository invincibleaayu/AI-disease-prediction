I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two.

Then I went to see my sleep doctor and he prescribed me 250 mg of Nuvigil. It finally allowed me to stay awake for an entire day.

Ginanvi had cleared up my acne in the short time I used and I was hoping this birth control would not mess that up. I was wrong. After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it. It also made my period &quot;weird&quot;. I would have little to no period one month and a heavy one the next . The month that I had a heavier flow my boobs would hurt a lot.

MD informed me after this dose it becomes less effective for sleep, so why even bother.  15 years of trying different sleep medications and alternatives, and this, I can say for sure, was the LEAST effective I have ever come across.  At it&#039;s low price point, feel free to give it a try, and maybe you will be luckier?  Everyone&#039;s sleep conditions are different.

1103	Metronidazole	Rosacea	"""Many people don&#039;t seem to like Metrogel, but for me its really made a difference in my Rosacea. One thing rosacea sufferers have to realize is that this treatment takes time. I would have to say that it took a good 2.5 months to start seeing noticeable improvement with continued improvement the longer I use it. On a side note I would like to add that my ears would flush when triggered by heat or stress and so I started to use Metrogel on them and it has helped reduce the flushing. Overall pretty happy with results only negative aspect is the amount of time it takes for it to work."""	9	29-Feb-12	110
72195	Tramadol	Chronic Pain	"""I take it for gastrointestinal pain and it works fairly well. My pain often gets to the point of me wanting to punch everything in sight, and tramadol helps to quiet it. The only downsides are that it takes a little longer to start working than I need it to, since this unbearable pain can arise in a few minutes. Additionally, it causes constipation even in low doses, which can contribute to further gastrointestinal pain."""	9	31-May-14	20

After a few days i experienced very mild itching and some slight redness, but this may have been my imagination. The warts seemed to get bigger at the start but quickly vanished and now i have no visible warts at all! I used Warticon before and it did absolutely nothing, so i was thrilled to see something finally working. Give it time and patience. One word of advice,  i used this cream and got cryotherapy done around the same time. I would wait a week or so after cryo, apply the cream for a few weeks, then repeat of necessary. This seemed to really help."""	8	2-Nov-15	12

I took a tramadol 2 hours before my appointment. My doctor advised that it would be painful for a short while especially since I have never been pregnant. She was very good during the insertion about letting me know when pain would occur. It was very painful for about 3-4 hours. After that, it was similar to my normal cramps for 2 days. I spotted for the first 4 days just enough for a panty liner, not even a pad, and have not had any spotting since. I have had no issues with my boyfriend and the strings or being dry &quot;down there&quot; as I have read with some others. My sex drive has increased since having it."""	10	5-Mar-17	7

Over a forty day period my Lisinopril dosage was increased in stages from 5mg to 40mg in an attempt to get the same BP results I had with Amlodipine.  Prior to taking Lisinopril my blood pressure was around 135/75.  As the amount of Lisinopril was increased my blood pressure kept increasing. After 40 days it was around 175/85 (maximum 200/100).  I take my blood pressure 3 -4 times per day.   I experienced increased confusion, tiredness, dizziness, weakness and constipation as the dosage of Lisinopril was increased.

I&#039;ve tried other birth control pills before and had to go off of them because of weight gain. When I finally got back on the pills, I thought it was great because my periods were always regular, I had no weight gain, and my skin was flawless.  But, after being on it for 6 months now I&#039;m realizing that this pill is the reason for my poor mental health.  I went from being happy and satisfied with my life, to being an actual crazy person.  I started lashing out at the people I loved as the months progressed. I would have the worst mood swings of my life.  I would be happy and laughing, and the next minute I was in tears.  It turned me into an angry person that I didn&#039;t know."""	3	26-Sep-16	0
24509	Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes	Bowel Preparation	"""My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. 

The hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.

On Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. 

On Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before. I can only assume there was nothing left to eject.

I felt better within a week, but it did take 3-4 weeks for me to notice its full effect. I&#039;d describe the feeling it gives as light, airy and happy/drifty. I haven&#039;t experienced any side effects, and haven&#039;t gained any weight.

The Personal Trainer was a waste because Adipex with Zumba was doing a tremendous job all on its own. I wasn&#039;t craving sweets thanks to Adipex. I cut out fast foods, carbs, and late night eating. Plus I drank anywhere from 1/2 to a gallon A DAY! However, the medicine still made me constipated. I started at 244 and got down to 209lbs.

I was one of the unlucky ones who suffered through very severe symptoms the entire time. I had severe cramping/abdominal pain for the entirety of the time I was using the ring. They were so bad that I took time off from work because I could not stand up. I bled almost constantly the entire time, and it was very heavy spotting, heavier than I had ever had from a period before using the ring. I bled heavily during and after intercourse. 

After the cramps became unbearable and I could not stand bleeding as heavily as I was I decided to come off nuva ring. It took my body seven months to stop bleeding heavily. I had heavy periods for two weeks at a time as my body readjusted. And even now my periods last longer than they did before using the ring. I also have spotting in between periods, and I never had spotting before using the ring.

I have dropped to this dose over the last year. (I also left the old patch on). I have been on opiates for 12 years full time prescribed. At my highest prescription I was using 180mg of Oxycodone and 180 mg of morphine per day. I have had several adjustments on medicine including extended release doses. 5 years ago I was put on 50 mug of Fanta to with 3-10 mg Oxys per day for breakthrough. I started leaving my old patches on to increase my daily dose. This last year I tapered Down to 25 mcg patches for 48 hours.( still leaving my old patches on.) I went to a doctor that prescribes Suboxone. Lucky for me my insurance pays for Suboxone. He gave me the 8/2 mg strips. I take 1/2 a strip twice a day. I was checking every forum to see how long I needed to wait to start the suboxone. The replies are all very different. Some say 16 hours, most day 24. Others say 48-36-72 hours. Yikes! How do I keep out of precipitated withdrawals! I already have withdrawals every other day on my patch!... so I removed my patch last night around 5 pm. (I already have my suboxone script at home. ) so I started feeling withdrawal symptoms coming on around 11 pm. They didn&#039;t get super intense. I checked the cows scale as many articles suggested but only scored mild.. had the stretching of limbs symptom, anxiety.. so I took a half of a strip which was the suggested dose. I took it at 12 noon today. That&#039;s only 19-20 hours. I was in withdrawals, but not the worst I have ever had. I was scared of the precipitated withdrawals I heard about. 10-15 minutes after I took it, I felt a hot sensation wash over me. Thought I would get those withdrawals, but I took a quick bath, laid down for an hour and. Is I feel pretty good. Took my withdrawals away. I still have some muscle pain, but not the kind that come from withdrawals. Suboxone stopped the withdrawals right away. No headaches or sick feeling. Not high, but even my regular dose meds haven&#039;t made me high for years... so if your guessing on when it&#039;s ok to take suboxone after opiates, and fentanyl seems to be the highest strength, then I day shoot for 24 hours. If you are not in withdrawals at 24, then wait until you are.. if you are in withdrawals before 24 hours then just wait as long as you can. You will know when it&#039;s too bad to wait anymore. You know your body... you can always take half the amount prescribed and see how it reacts if your are afraid of precipitated withdrawals. Trust me, it will stop the withdrawals within a half hour. I have not gotten the precipices withdrawals so far. Hope this helps someone. Good luck to you!"""	9	27-May-17	24

I don&#039;t think about eating, I will force myself to eat a little bit of something healthy every few hours, the side effects were scarey the first two days but after that my body pretty much got used to them. Anyone looking to lose weight this is most definitely a jump start way!"""	10	1-Mar-14	32

Spoke to the doctor.  He recommended drinking second dose slowly.  That helped to keep it down, but headache/chills is worse and nausea kicked it.

SECOND- was bleeding every so often, hairloss, appetite change, hardly any sex drive, moodiness. And had heavy chest and heart issues (still unknown at the moment) THIRD- bleeding got worse. Would bleed for a week, stop for 1 day or 2, then start again and it&#039;s been like this since, very dark blood but very light but it&#039;s more than spotting.

Now, I eat small amounts of healthy foods that taste so good to me and dont make me feel sick.  Foods I used to eat now make me nauseous.  I have plenty of energy. Small amounts now give a full feeling.  I enjoy slow eating now and all the tastes.  I got dry mouth at first but now don&#039;t as I drink water like everyone says you should.  Only now I enjoy it.

I had been taking Seasonale birth control pills without a break after the third month and not having a period for the past 4 years.  I am in the military and deploying without having to worry about taking along 6 months worth of birth control and menstruation products is a HUGE relief.  I had some cramping after the insertion but took two OTC pain relievers and haven&#039;t felt anything since.  I&#039;ve run miles with it in, I&#039;ve done push-ups and sit-ups and not felt a thing.

I had no sign of a period at all for over a week and a half. I woke up everyday freaking out! Yesterday I got spotting and then my mind raced and I googled everything! Today AF came. 12 days after plan b and 1 week late on period.

Mind you before having him my periods were &quot;normal.&quot; After having him, my period was EXTREMELY heavy lasting 5 to 7 days. I was going through 3 and 4 super pads WITH super tampons. I used with it each day until the last day. It was horrible! That lasted for a year because I breastfed.

If you take it too late it will keep you awake. I am on other med for Bipolar that cause weight gain, but this med seems to be the opposite and has actually helped me lose weight. Sometimes the med &quot;runs out&quot; in the afternoon and you can kind of feel the let down. It works great for depression and would be good if used by itself for weight loss.

The only side effect I sometimes get is dry mouth, so make sure to drink plenty of water if that happens to you. Biotene mouthwash also helps with that.

Now, on the same dosage for 3 years, I have memory loss, severe exhaustion and fatigue, headaches and dizziness every day and my school work is being negatively affected.

Zoloft helped take the edge off but it gave me sexual side effects and kind of made me numb. Pristiq is the best thing ever. I noticed almost immediately that it was working. The first week was rough and I felt a little more anxious. The only side effects I have are like at night I sometimes see halos around lights and I urinate a lot more often.

I&#039;ve gained probably 30 lbs since I had it put in in January 2014. I&#039;m moody and have no sex drive. I exercise regularly and eat fairly well. I keep gaining weight and I hate it. I love the convenience of this birth control but I can&#039;t handle the side effects. I&#039;m giving it 3 more months to see if my body can adjust to it but if not.....I&#039;m done.

When Harvoni became available it was like a huge blessing, I was so grateful for the chance to get rid of HepC.

By the end of the first week they became tolerable, but I was still spotting. There were 2 or 3 days when I didn&#039;t spot, then I started having bad cramps again + spotting, and a long and painful period followed that was a little lighter than usual.

I also suffer from PCOS and saw dramatic improvement with my periods. They became lighter and always on their time, whereas before the pill I used to bleed 2-3 times per month. However, this pill is not a panacea and it is definitely not harmless. My libido has reduced, I  too experience the occasional paranoia and extreme irritability, my cholesterol and triglycerides have risen although I follow a balanced diet and exercise but I did not gain any weight.

I had little to no acne before taking it, and I have noticed I only get a few pimples here and there, my sex drive has not changed at all still pretty good.

At first I was pleased by the lack of noticeable side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It didn&#039;t make me groggy during the day, nor did I experience any muscle twitches. However, at about the third month on 20 mg, I began getting severe akathesia shortly after ingesting. It manifested with inner restlessness (not normal for me), anxiety, and inability to stop moving.

The NuvaRing was great for my skin and regulating and shortening my periods but oh my god did it ever mess me up mentally. I was tired all the time, so moody and depressed, made me feel suicidal and unhappy all the time so thats why I switched.

I used Drysol at first once a week (using it 2 nights in a row gave me an armpit rash which hurt) but I used it when I needed *if I smelled and was sweating I would use it again that night*  I find the next night after using it my armpits are a little itchy, but I have nothing to say but good things about Drysol.  6 years later I don&#039;t even remember the last time I used it (maybe months ago) I have saved money on ruined shirts from pit stains and I don&#039;t ever smell.

I tried using supplements as recommended by  Julia Ross in her book The Mood Cure, but they were not effective for me.  My depression became so severe last Oct. that I had to go back on to an anti-depressant (Bupropion) but this medication made my depression much worse.  I was then put onto Trintellix in April.  The Trintellix was helpful, but side effects soon began to appear.  

I happened upon an article about a psychiatrist who had used niacin for treating depression.   When I googled niacin and depression, I came upon many other blogs and comments from other people who also found niacin to be effective against their struggles with depression. 

 I was desperate to find an alternative to taking anti-depressants, so 4 weeks ago, I began supplementing with niacin plus vitamin C.   (I had already been taking a vitamin B multi, magnesium, fish oil and Vit. D).  I started with 100mcg niacin and have been gradually increasing the dose by 25mcg increments each day.  I use only the regular niacin, not the timed release nor the non-flushing type.

Since I started taking the additional niacin &amp; vitamin C,  I find that my depression is/has diminished significantly.

Unfortunately, less than a week into the sample pack, I started getting unusual sharp pains in my left leg and foot. Then, twice in the same day, I felt a shocking pain on the right side of my head/face/neck, so bad I instinctively curled up and held my head. I stopped taking the pill and felt no more pains.

It&#039;s GABAergic effect is most noticeable when taken during a time of discomfort.

Kava has quickly reversed full-blown panic attacks and also markedly reduced pain, probably because of it&#039;s direct muscle relaxation. I also sleep like a baby after taking it.

And I had just take a job 350 miles from home.  I started with a white cap, a 1.0  mg.  It worked great for me, but some people had problems with that dose of 1 mg and the FDA said doctors could not write anything above .50, or two white caps, .25.  When I had to reduce my dose, it took me 6 months to get my body adjusted.  So, 31 years later, I am 59 now and have to have the .50 to sleep.

A couple months of severe flu-like symptoms and I&#039;ll cry very easily over anything even remotely sad. Also causes me to start rapid-cycling between euphoria, mixed and extreme depression.

I was also prescribed Xanax to take along with Clonazepam due to having a panic disorder as well as generalized anxiety, but after about a year I decided that the Xanax was pretty useless (and tasted like wet chalk) so asked my psychiatrist to stop prescribing it.

I see the comments that people have received chemical burns or other painful issues with this product. It may be that their ph levels are off and it isn&#039;t a YI that they have in the first place. I&#039;d advise you to use a vaginal ph first and go from there."""	10	18-Jan-17	1

Depression is found in each condition, and I find for myself that depression is by far the most debilitating condition of all. I first tried Paxil 12 years ago for depression and anxiety. The Paxil worked great. The side effects included a little nausea (which is basically eliminated by eating something with or soon after taking the med) and some sexual issues (which I believe can be negotiated after you get used to the Paxil). I quit taking it when I switched insurance and because of the perceived stigma I had with taking anything for conditions I didn&#039;t want to even acknowledge.

Additionally all my blood lipids were way out of range.  I was given 40 mg of atorvastatin but after reading how horrible statins were, I got scared and only took 1/2 daily.

I have experienced some hair thinning at the crown of my head, but since I am 70 years old I cannot be sure that was caused by Elmiron.

But they took me off for another kind and my opiates for pain and anxiety relief weren&#039;t being helped at all.  They just switched me and I notice the same aid to my medication the benzo&#039;s provided minus the fog.

I was blessed to be a part of a Fibromyalgia group at University of Michigan and got to meet and be examined by the head of their Neurology department who advised me to try Cymbalta.

It&#039;s been about 10 hours since the insertion and I still have mild cramping. I took ibuprofen prior to my appointment and haven&#039;t taken more. My experience was no where near as bad as I was expecting based on other reviews. As many have pointed out, everybody&#039;s body is different."""	10	17-Feb-17	4

My mood swings became less volatile and it gives me a &quot;buffer period&quot; between actions and my reactions so that I am able to think about what is happening and react in an appropriate way.

The Suprep was pretty gross (salty, grape flavor) and the 1st bottle is much easier going down then the 2nd. I did throw up with both, but managed to keep most of it down. It worked and worked quickly! Best advice I read was to eat lightly a couple days prior and it made things so much easier and tolerable. Kept plenty of fluids (Gatorade, ginger ale, apple juice) butterscotch candy and chicken broth. As far as procedure, I was beyond nervous and it was complete cake! Staff was great, explained step by step, gave me meds (completely sedated) and next thing I knew it was over and I was awake!"""	8	19-Oct-15	10

I take 900mg lithium/400mg seroquel /400mg lamotragine. Up until 2013 I was in/out of serious episodes that would last for months and destroy my life. I was taking 150mg of seroquel and my doc was hesitant to increase my dose. This increase of dose saved me. I am no longer controlled by this disease, rarely have episodes.

It also gave me CONSTANT cramps. I would have cramps every single day and when I was on my period they were just way worse. I was taking way too many ibuprofen a day and they eventually stopped working for me. No other pain killer could even put a dent in the pain from these cramps. The only thing that helped was my left over vicodin from surgery. I was 100 lbs and taking high doses of vicodin just to go to school. Doctor made me continue to take it for 6 months despite horrible pain. Nothing changed. Thankfully off it now please don&#039;t take this drug it is awful."""	1	4-Aug-17	0

Erectile dysfunction is difficult to deal with for men of any age, especially so when you are in your 20s (I&#039;m 24) and are supposed to be at your peak sexually. I&#039;m using the 25mg Pfizer tablets and they work amazingly well. No side effects. I now have very strong and rock hard erections. I&#039;m a much happier and relaxed man now.

About a month ago I starting drinking wine again ( I got a reaction the first time, but was fine after that), and 3 weeks ago I started on coffee again (it made me hyperactive for the first week, then normalised).

The first hour or so was no problem...then the burning started immediately. I wanted to remove my vagina from my body it was so bad. I ended trying to get it out after 2 days due to burning.

I reduced my adjunct Metformin from 1500mg daily to 1000 mg daily. Weight loss has been a nice side effect, especially since it impinges on the illness in the first place.

I also had went from hardly any periods to 2 periods per pack. I guess it was thought as me making up for lost time.

I have had 2 panic attacks today but so far so good. The Zoloft did keep them from going full blown. It&#039;s like I just all of a sudden began to calm down. I still feel a little anxious but I definitely have energy now. I started out on 25mg and then increased to 50mg the following week. I do have excessive yawning and some fatigue but overall this medicine is awesome. The doctors decided to try me on this because one day I just woke up and began to have panic attacks and they continually got worse. I was on Celexa 20mg which didn&#039;t help at all with anxiety.

Feeling flat and NO motivation to even brush my teeth. Went down to 25mg for a few days and now back to 50mg. On day 11 now and most of the depression has lifted. OCD isn&#039;t as bad, its more controllable, anxiety still there a bit. If this is the beginning of the future I&#039;m happy. It was worth the initial start!

I used to get horrible side effects from the pill but the only negative side effect from the Nuva ring is that about 2 weeks out of the month I don&#039;t have really any sex drive but I&#039;ll take that over acting like a lunatic and not even getting to have sex cause I scared my partner off haha.

I&#039;ve had the implant for 2 years now, and my complaint list is minimal, yes it prevents pregnancy but the irregular periods and spotting are very annoying because you never know when it&#039;s going to happen, it&#039;s always a suprise and very inconvenient.

I&#039;ve been getting cystic acne all over my cheeks and chin.  And the worst part is that they severely scarred my skin and I never scarred before taking birth control.  I&#039;ve heard that in the first few months it can get worse before it gets better but I&#039;m on my 9th month and it just continues to get worse.

Abreva never cured my fever blisters in the 2.5 days they say it can, but it did used to help. This time, it exacerbated my blister, and it is HUGE! It has not spread like the other reviews have stated, but it&#039;s larger than normal, and I can only imagine that it&#039;s the Abreva I&#039;ve been using 5-8 times a day. Do not use this product.

Crackers did seem to help though, if you get this side effect treat it as if you had morning sickness. I also take my pills at night instead of the morning. There were also some days I was a total b!tch, but that could also just be my personality. As for weight gain, absolutely NONE. In fact, I lost weight when I watched my calories and exercised, so the pills had no effect on my metabolism.

I stopped three days ago and was worried I would have severe withdrawals however since taking Baclofen I have been absolutely fine (started on a dose of 10mg and gone up to 30mg but this depends on your dependency on alcohol). I have been thinking of alcohol lots which is expected but I&#039;m been sleeping better than when I do drink (as I normally wake up at 3am with extreme anxiety or worries in my life) and now don&#039;t feel any anxiety. I&#039;m determined to stay on this path and feel proud of myself already.

Now that I&#039;m on the placebo week my period which is normally light/medium to medium flow is so incredibly heavy.

I am 48, finished chemo and radiation for breast cancer about 6 months ago, so I don&#039;t know if that has affected my experience.  And my Dad had stage IV colon cancer so I know other preps are not easy either. But the taste of this is unbearable and vile! I had severe bloating and nausea, took a Zofran after speaking to the nurse.. About 2 hours later I ate half a bowl of broth and had 6 or more projectile vomiting. Called the Dr, he said don&#039;t take the 2nd bottle, indicated it worked faster in me, I assume. Had jello &amp; Sprite later, 2 hours from that more stomach pain and 7 more projectile vomiting.
