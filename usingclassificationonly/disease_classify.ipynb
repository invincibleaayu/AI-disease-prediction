    "## Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to analyze the symptoms using Natural Language Processing. The project will be evaluated using both the accuracy of correct prediction. There will be predictions for disease like Anxity, Birth Control, Depression, Diabetes, Type 2, etc. The study will be completed in few steps as mentioned below. This will give an explanation as to how words are extracted can be used to predict the medical condition of a patient. Our group plans to use several types of analyses to help predict the medical condition based on symptoms  TFIDF tokenizers and different classification algorithm."
