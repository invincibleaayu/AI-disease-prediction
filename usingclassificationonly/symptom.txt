The patient is a female in her 50's who presents for a routine mammography. A density is identified at the 10:00 position in the left breast on craniocaudal (LCC) and mediolateral (LML) views (Figure 1). To further examine this lesion, diagnostic mammography, left breast ultrasound, and a left axillary ultrasound are performed. The ultrasound of the left breast demonstrates an irregular, hypoechoic nodule in the 10:00 region, 2 cm deep to the nipple and measuring 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.1 cm (Figure 2). The diagnostic mammography recapitulates these findings. The left axillary ultrasound shows normal appearing lymph nodes. The nodule is classified as indeterminate by the radiologist and ultrasound-guided biopsy of the lesion is recommended. This was consistent with a BI-RADS category of 4A, denoting a suspicious abnormality. The patient underwent an ultrasound guided biopsy with clip placement at the biopsy site.

The results of the biopsy showed a sclerotic papillary lesion, florid adenosis, ductal epithelial hyperplasia, fibrocystic changes, necrosis, and calcifications. It was recommended that she pursue surgical excision of the lesion. She subsequently underwent ultrasound-guided radioactive seed placement and radioactive seed localized excisional biopsy of the left breast lesion.
